# Python Modules ----

# There are two types of modules in python -- 
# a). Built-in Module - Modules which are ready to import and use, and gets installed with python interpreter so we don't need to install them extensively.
# b). External Module - Modules which are imported from third party files or can be installed using a package manager like pip or conda.
